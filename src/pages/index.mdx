## about-me

A long time ago I was a designer, and then after a few years I realised code is just better. I’ve held various positions in and around advertising and web development in both permanent and contract positions since 2005.

In 2012 I co-founded and ran **award** wining digital production agency Super natural until 2016. Since then I’ve been contracting and love React, user interface development and data visualization. I have good JavaScript knowledge but wouldn't class myself as a hardcore JavaScript engineer.

My primary focus over the last few years has been building custom React UI Libraries using Storybook and StyledComponents and developing multiple Gatsby.js themes and plugins.

I’m a huge fan of process and have worked with some great developers in some very well organized engineering teams. I’m familiar with and enjoy agile working processes... but after all is said and done structure + order = fun.

You can find out more about me on my [blog](http://www.paulie.dev/) and read my cv/resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Z8w-099fRjVB1zA1Y9F3zVWtW1RfIxnOTIyrYn0HcY/edit)
